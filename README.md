# Soar-Smart-Roadside-Infrastructure-System
This is the official implementation of the paper ***Soar*: Design and Deployment of A Smart Roadside Infrastructure System for Autonomous Driving. (MobiCom 2024)**

The software system of *Soar* consists of communication and computing modules (r.f., Section 4 and 5 in the paper). The communication module (/communication) includes our modified Wi-Fi driver and the implementation of a data transmitter and receiver for I2V communication. The computing module (/computing) features our data and task management design.
